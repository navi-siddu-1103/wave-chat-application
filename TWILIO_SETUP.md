# Twilio SMS Setup Guide (Optional)

Currently, the app works in **development mode** with simulated SMS. Verification codes are shown in:
1. **Browser notifications/toasts** 
2. **Browser console** (F12 → Console)
3. **Server terminal** 
4. **Blue info box** on verification screen

## Current Status: ✅ Working without Twilio

The phone authentication is fully functional in development mode. You can:
- Register with any phone number
- Get verification codes instantly
- Complete the full authentication flow

## To Enable Real SMS (Optional)

If you want to send actual SMS messages, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Twilio Account
1. Go to [Twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your own phone number during signup

### 2. Get Credentials
From your Twilio Console Dashboard:
- **Account SID** (starts with AC...)
- **Auth Token** (click to reveal)
- **Phone Number** (from Phone Numbers → Manage → Active numbers)

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Twilio SMS Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

### 4. Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Free Tier Limitations

Twilio free accounts can only send SMS to:
- ✅ Your verified phone number
- ✅ Other verified numbers you add
- ❌ Any random phone number

For production, you'll need to upgrade to a paid plan.

## Cost Estimate

- **SMS messages**: ~$0.0075 per message
- **Phone number**: ~$1/month
- **Free trial**: $15 credit

## Alternative: Keep Development Mode

For testing and development, the current simulation mode is perfect:
- ✅ No API costs
- ✅ Instant verification codes
- ✅ No rate limits
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ No account setup needed

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, you have options:
1. **Use Twilio** for real SMS (recommended)
2. **Use alternative SMS providers** (AWS SNS, MessageBird, etc.)
3. **Implement email verification** instead of SMS
4. **Use third-party auth** (Firebase Auth, Auth0, etc.)

The current code structure makes it easy to switch between providers.
